# Data Collection of Analytics

Dozzle collects anonymous user configurations using Google Analytics. _Why?_ Dozzle is an open source project with no funding. As a result, there is no time to do user studies of Dozzle. Analytics is collected to prioritize features and fixes based on how people use Dozzle. This data is completely public and can be viewed live using [dashboard](/guide/usage-dashboard).

## Where is data stored

Dozzle's sends anonymous data to Google Analytics. Retention policy is 14 months which is lowest [possible value for Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7667196).

## Opting out

Dozzle analytics helps to prioritize features and spend time on most important features. If you do not want to be tracked at all, use `--no-analytics` flag or `DOZZLE_NO_ANALYTICS` env variable.
